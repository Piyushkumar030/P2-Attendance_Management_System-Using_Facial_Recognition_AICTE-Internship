# Attendance_Management_System-Using_Facial_Recognition_AICTE-Internship

## Overview of the project
The "Attendance Management System" is a Python-driven application that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition. With OpenCV-python powering face detection and recognition, and SQLite managing the database for user and attendance records, the system ensures reliability and hold good functionality. A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter enhances accessibility.Its  features include capturing training images, real-time recognition, and streamlined attendance management.

* Problem
Taking attendance manually can be slow, full of mistakes, and not always reliable. In schools, offices, or events, it often causes delays and can be easily misused.

* Challenges
Sometimes people forget to mark attendance, or someone might mark it for someone else. This leads to incomplete or incorrect records, causing confusion and problems later.

* Solution
The Attendance Management System uses face recognition technology to take attendance quickly and accurately. It scans faces through a camera, identifies the person, and securely saves the attendance in an SQLite database. This saves time, avoids errors, and makes the process smooth and trustworthy.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Secure registration and login with username and password.
- **Face Recognition for Attendance**: Automatic attendance marking through facial recognition, reducing human intervention.
- **Attendance History**: Allows users to check their previous attendance logs with date and time.
- **Database Integration**: All user data and attendance logs are stored in an SQLite database for easy management and retrieval at anytime.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
  - Install with: `pip install opencv-python`
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, self-contained database used to store user details and attendance records.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
  - Install with: `pip install tk`
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork used for processing and handling images (e.g., resizing).
  - Install with: `pip install pillow`
- **NumPy**: Provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, used with OpenCV for face recognition.
  - Install with:
    `pip install numpy`

## Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone P2-Attendance_Management_System-Using_Facial_Recognition_AICTE-Internship.git
cd P2-Attendance_Management_System-Using_Facial_Recognition_AICTE-Internship
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
Ensure Python is installed on your system, then install the necessary dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up SQLite Database
- Create a SQLite database(here, user.db) to store attendance records.
- Update the database connection details in the code as needed.

### 4. Download Haarcascade
Download the Haarcascade XML file for face detection from the [OpenCV GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and place it in the project directory.

## Working

### 1. Capture Images
- Run `main_gui.py` to open the GUI and it is the main file of the project.
- Enter the Username and Password for registration.
- Then Click on Login Button.
- After that , window for marking attendance using facial identification opens.
- Camera opens, and images are captured.
- Click 'ctrl+q' to finish capturing images.

### 2. Train the Model
- After capturing images, run `train_model.py` in cmd to train the face recognition model.

### 3. Automatic Attendance
- Select `Mark Today's Attendance` to automatically mark attendance for the day, a message can be seen in cmd(terminal).

### 5. View History
- Access the `Attendance History` button to view the details of attendance.
